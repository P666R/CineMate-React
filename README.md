## CineMate React App using Typescript

It is a movies searching app which displays all the details you are looking for including movie name, release year, cast, director, plot, genre etc.

Also allows us to rate movies and add the movies to a personalised list. The data of the list is stored in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
